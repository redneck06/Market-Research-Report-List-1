<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Bypass Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Bypass Valves</li><li>Self-operated Bypass Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air bypass valve market consists of two main types: pressure bypass valves and self-operated bypass valves. </p><p>Pressure bypass valves are designed to regulate the pressure in a system by diverting excess air flow away from the main flow path. They are typically controlled by a pressure controller or pilot valve, which opens or closes the bypass valve to maintain a desired pressure level.</p><p>Self-operated bypass valves, on the other hand, do not require external control signals. They are designed to automatically open or close based on the pressure difference across the valve. This allows them to regulate air flow without the need for additional control devices.</p></p>
