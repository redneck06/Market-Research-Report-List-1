<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Solar Pool Blanket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Formula</li><li>Non-concentrated Formula</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquid solar pool blanket market offers two types of formulas: concentrated and non-concentrated. The concentrated formula is a highly potent solution that requires dilution before application. It provides better heat retention and evaporation reduction properties, making it more effective in preserving pool water temperature. On the other hand, the non-concentrated formula is ready-to-use and does not require dilution. Although it may not offer the same level of performance as the concentrated formula, it still provides some degree of heat retention and evaporation reduction for those seeking a convenient and less potent option.</p></p>
