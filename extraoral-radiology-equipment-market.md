<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extraoral Radiology Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Panoramic</li><li>CBCT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extraoral radiology equipment refers to devices used to capture images of the entire skull or jawbone, and it can be classified into two types: panoramic and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems. Panoramic machines utilize a rotating arm to capture an image of the patient's entire mouth in one panoramic view. On the other hand, CBCT systems utilize cone-shaped X-ray beams to produce detailed three-dimensional images of the patient's oral and maxillofacial region. These devices are essential in dentistry for diagnosing and treating various dental conditions.</p></p>
