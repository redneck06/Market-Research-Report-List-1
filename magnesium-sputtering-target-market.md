<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The magnesium sputtering target market can be classified into two types: rotary type and non-rotatable type. The rotary type sputtering targets are designed to rotate during the sputtering process, which helps to achieve a more uniform deposition of the magnesium film on the substrate. On the other hand, non-rotatable sputtering targets remain stationary during the sputtering, making them suitable for applications where rotation is not required. Both types cater to specific needs, allowing manufacturers to choose the most suitable option based on their requirements.</p></p>
