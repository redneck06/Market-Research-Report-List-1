<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmacokinetics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Noncompartmental Methods</li><li>Compartmental Methods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pharmacokinetics refers to the study of how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated in the body. The market for pharmacokinetics can be divided into two types - noncompartmental methods and compartmental methods. </p><p>Noncompartmental methods involve analyzing drug concentration and time data without assuming any specific biological model. It provides a simplified approach to understand drug behavior in the body. </p><p>On the other hand, compartmental methods utilize mathematical models to represent the different physiological compartments involved in drug distribution. This allows for a more detailed and precise analysis of drug pharmacokinetics and efficacy within the body.</p></p>
