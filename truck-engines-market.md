<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diesel Engine</li><li>Gasoline Engine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck engines market consists of two main types: diesel engines and gasoline engines. Diesel engines are more commonly used in larger trucks due to their higher torque and fuel efficiency. They operate by compressing air within the cylinders and injecting diesel fuel into the compressed air, igniting through compression. Gasoline engines, on the other hand, are typically found in smaller trucks and provide higher horsepower. They work by compressing a fuel-air mixture in the combustion chamber, igniting the spark plug to ignite the mixture.</p></p>
