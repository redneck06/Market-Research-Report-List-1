<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolization Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pushable Embolization Coil</li><li>Detachable Embolization Coil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Embolization Coil market can be categorized into two types, namely Pushable Embolization Coil and Detachable Embolization Coil. Pushable Embolization Coil is a type of coil that is permanently attached to the delivery catheter and remains inside the blood vessel to obstruct blood flow. On the other hand, Detachable Embolization Coil is a coil that can be detached from the delivery catheter once it is correctly positioned within the blood vessel, allowing for more precise placement and repositioning if needed. Both types are used in medical procedures to treat abnormal blood vessel conditions.</p></p>
