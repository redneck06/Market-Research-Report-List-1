<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distribution Voltage Regulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ferroresonant Switching</li><li>Tap Switching</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Distribution Voltage Regulator Market includes two main types â€“ Ferroresonant Switching and Tap Switching. Ferroresonant Switching is a type of regulator that uses a magnetic core transformer to regulate the output voltage. It works by utilizing the ferroresonant characteristics of the core material. Tap Switching, on the other hand, is a type of regulator that adjusts the output voltage by changing the number of transformer windings connected to the output terminals. It allows for voltage adjustment in small increments to ensure the desired output voltage level.</p></p>
