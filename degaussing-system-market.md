<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Degaussing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Degaussing System</li><li>Shipborne Degaussing System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Degaussing System Market includes two main types: External Degaussing System and Shipborne Degaussing System. The External Degaussing System is used to remove or neutralize the magnetic field of a vessel, such as a ship or submarine, by using powerful electromagnets. This process helps in reducing the magnetic signature of the vessel, making it less susceptible to detection by magnetic sensors or mines. On the other hand, Shipborne Degaussing System is a compact version primarily integrated into naval ships, aiding in reducing the magnetic fields generated by the ship's electrical systems, providing protection against magnetic mines and ensuring safety for the vessel and its crew.</p></p>
