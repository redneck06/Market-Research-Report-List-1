<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brain Machine Interfaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) refer to technologies that facilitate communication between the brain and external devices. There are two main types of BMIs: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive BMIs require a surgical procedure to implant electrodes directly into the brain, allowing for precise neural recording and stimulation. Non-invasive BMIs, on the other hand, do not require surgery and utilize external sensors to detect brain activity. While invasive BMIs provide higher resolution and control, they carry more risks and are less accessible. Non-invasive BMIs, although offering lower resolution, are safer and more widely applicable.</p></p>
