<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gantry Cranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Main Girder</li><li>Double Main Girder</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gantry cranes are classified into two main types: single main girder and double main girder. Single main girder gantry cranes consist of a single beam that spans the width of the crane. These cranes are commonly used in industries where lighter loads need to be moved. On the other hand, double main girder gantry cranes consist of two parallel beams that support the hoist. They are suitable for industries with heavier loads as they provide increased lifting capacity and stability. Both types of gantry cranes have their own advantages depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
