<p><p>Portfolio management can be categorized into fee-based and commission-based markets. In fee-based markets, investors pay a fixed fee to the portfolio manager for their services, regardless of the number of transactions conducted or the size of the portfolio. This structure ensures transparency and aligns the interests of both parties. On the other hand, commission-based markets involve investors paying a commission for each transaction made by the portfolio manager. This approach may lead to potential conflicts of interest, as the portfolio manager might prioritize generating more transactions to earn higher commissions.</p></p>
