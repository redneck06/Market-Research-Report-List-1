<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Video Bronchoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Endoscopes</li><li>Flexible Endoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Video bronchoscopes are medical devices used by healthcare professionals to visualize and examine the inside of a patient's airway and lungs. There are two main types of video bronchoscopes: rigid endoscopes and flexible endoscopes. Rigid endoscopes are straight and rigid instruments that provide a clear image but are less flexible in navigating through narrow passages. On the other hand, flexible endoscopes are more maneuverable and can access difficult-to-reach areas, although the image quality may be slightly compromised. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating respiratory conditions.</p></p>
