<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Suction Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Suction Catheter</li><li>Closed Suction Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical suction catheters are devices used to remove bodily secretions from the respiratory system. There are two types of suction catheters: open suction catheter and closed suction catheter. </p><p>Open suction catheters are used for intermittent suctioning and consist of a flexible tube connected to a collection canister. The healthcare professional manually controls the suction by applying negative pressure with a syringe.</p><p>Closed suction catheters, on the other hand, are sealed systems that allow for continuous suctioning without disconnecting the patient from the ventilator. This minimizes the risk of infection and provides easier maneuverability. Closed suction catheters are commonly used in intensive care units and other critical care settings.</p></p>
