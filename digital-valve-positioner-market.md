<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Valve Positioner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Positioner</li><li>Double Acting Positioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Digital Valve Positioner market comprises two types: Single Acting Positioner and Double Acting Positioner. A Single Acting Positioner is used in applications where the valve requires a spring to return it to its original position. It ensures accurate valve positioning by receiving a pneumatic input signal and adjusting the position accordingly. In contrast, a Double Acting Positioner is suitable for valves that do not require a spring for closure and opening. It receives and processes pneumatic signals to enable precise valve control. Both types enhance valve efficiency and reliability in industrial processes.</p></p>
