<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interventional Spine Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertebroplasty</li><li>Kyphoplasty</li><li>Radiofrequency Ablation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interventional spine devices market includes various types such as vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and radiofrequency ablation. Vertebroplasty involves the injection of bone cement into fractured vertebrae to stabilize and relieve pain. Kyphoplasty is a similar procedure that restores the height of collapsed vertebrae using an inflatable balloon before injecting the cement. Lastly, radiofrequency ablation uses heat generated by radio waves to target and destroy nerve tissue that is causing pain in the spine. These devices offer minimally invasive treatment options for individuals suffering from spinal conditions.</p></p>
