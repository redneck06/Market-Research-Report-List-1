<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peeler Centrifuges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Peeler Centrifuge</li><li>Horizontal Peeler Centrifuge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peeler centrifuges are commonly used in industries to separate solids from liquids. The market types for peeler centrifuges can be categorized into two main types: vertical peeler centrifuge and horizontal peeler centrifuge. </p><p>Vertical peeler centrifuges are designed with a vertical axis, where the feed is introduced from the top and the separation takes place as the liquid passes through the perforated basket and the solids are retained. </p><p>On the other hand, horizontal peeler centrifuges have a horizontal axis, allowing for a continuous feed and discharge process. The separation occurs as the liquid is forced out through the basket perforations, while the solids are retained inside and regularly discharged.</p></p>
