<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DMLS 3D Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coaxial Powder Feeding</li><li>Roller Powder Feeding</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) 3D printers are used to manufacture metal parts through a layer-by-layer additive process. Two common market types of DMLS 3D printers are Coaxial Powder Feeding and Roller Powder Feeding. </p><p>In Coaxial Powder Feeding, the metal powder and laser are delivered through the same nozzle, allowing for precise control and efficient material usage. This method enables highly complex designs and reduces powder waste.</p><p>On the other hand, Roller Powder Feeding involves a roller system that continuously supplies powder to the build area. This allows for faster print speeds and higher productivity but may result in slightly less accuracy compared to Coaxial Powder Feeding.</p></p>
