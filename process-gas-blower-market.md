<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Process Gas Blower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement Blower</li><li>Centrifugal Blower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Process gas blowers are widely used in various industrial applications to provide a steady flow of gas or air. There are two main types of process gas blowers: positive displacement blowers and centrifugal blowers.</p><p>Positive displacement blowers operate by trapping gas between rotating lobes and the blower housing, pushing the gas out as the lobes rotate. These blowers are known for their high pressure capabilities and are commonly used in applications that require high pressure.</p><p>Centrifugal blowers, on the other hand, use centrifugal force to accelerate the gas and deliver it at a high velocity. They are known for their ability to deliver large volumes of gas at low pressures. Centrifugal blowers are commonly used in applications that require a high flow rate.</p><p>Both types of blowers have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
