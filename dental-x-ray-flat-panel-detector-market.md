<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental X-ray flat panel detector market consists of two types: direct conversion and indirect conversion. In direct conversion, the X-ray photons are directly converted into electrical signals by using a sensor material made of amorphous selenium or other similar materials. This type offers better image quality and sensitivity. In indirect conversion, X-ray photons are first converted into visible light by using a scintillator material, and then the visible light is converted into electrical signals by a photosensitive sensor. This type is less expensive but may result in lower image quality.</p></p>
