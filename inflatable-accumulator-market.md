<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inflatable Accumulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>Spring-type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Inflatable accumulator market primarily consists of two types: gravity and spring-type. Gravity-type accumulators store energy by utilizing the force of gravity acting on a mass, which pushes fluid into the accumulator. On the other hand, spring-type accumulators use springs to store energy by compressing the fluid within the accumulator. Both types help in maintaining system pressure during operations, but gravity-type accumulators are generally larger and better suited for high-volume applications, while spring-type accumulators are smaller and more suitable for space-constrained applications.</p></p>
