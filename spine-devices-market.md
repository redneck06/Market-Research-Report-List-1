<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spine Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion Products</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spine devices market consists of two main types: spinal fusion products and non-fusion products. Spinal fusion products are used to connect two or more vertebrae together to promote bone growth and stabilize the spine. These products include screws, plates, rods, and cages. On the other hand, non-fusion products are designed to preserve motion in the spine rather than fusing the vertebrae. These products include artificial discs, dynamic stabilization devices, and interspinous process spacers. Both types of devices aim to address various spinal conditions and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
