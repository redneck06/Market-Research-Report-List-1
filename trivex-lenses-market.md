<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trivex Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Vision Lenses</li><li>Bifocal Lenses</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Trivex lenses market consists of two main types: single vision lenses and bifocal lenses. Single vision lenses offer a single prescription power throughout the entire lens, suitable for people with either nearsightedness or farsightedness. Bifocal lenses, on the other hand, have two distinct areas with different powers, usually used for individuals with both near and distance vision problems. These lenses enable clear vision at different distances, eliminating the need to switch between multiple pairs of glasses.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Trivex Lenses Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rimless Frames</li><li>Full-frame</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Trivex lenses market has applications in both rimless frames and full-frame eyewear. Rimless frames are designed without a frame around the lenses, offering a minimalist and lightweight option. Trivex lenses are a popular choice for rimless frames due to their durability, impact resistance, and thinness. On the other hand, the full-frame market refers to eyewear with a complete frame surrounding the lenses. Trivex lenses are also used in full-frame eyewear to provide excellent optical performance, strength, and scratch resistance.</p></p>
