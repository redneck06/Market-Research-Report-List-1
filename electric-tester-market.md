<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-type</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric tester market can be classified into two types: contact-type and contactless. Contact-type testers require physical contact with the object being tested. They measure electrical current or voltage by directly touching the conductive surface. On the other hand, contactless testers do not require direct physical contact. They use advanced technology like infrared or radio waves to measure and detect electrical fields and currents without making any physical connection. Both types serve the purpose of testing electrical systems and equipment, but differ in the way they make the measurements.</p></p>
