<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydronic Floor Heating Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Above-floor Systems</li><li>Below-floor Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydronic floor heating systems encompass two types: above-floor systems and below-floor systems. Above-floor systems involve the installation of thin pipes or panels above the subfloor, allowing for easier access and maintenance. They are commonly used in renovations or buildings where altering the existing floor is not possible. In contrast, below-floor systems require embedding pipes or cables within the concrete slab or under the floorboards, providing a more permanent solution suitable for new constructions. These systems offer comfortable and efficient heating by circulating hot water through the pipes while minimizing energy consumption.</p></p>
