<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyproheptadine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Patent</li><li>Generic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The market for cyproheptadine can be divided into two main types: Patent and generic. In the patent market, a pharmaceutical company holds exclusive rights to produce and sell the drug, allowing them to set a higher price to cover research and development costs. Once the patent expires, generic manufacturers can produce and sell their own versions at lower prices, as they do not have to invest in research. This creates competition and provides more affordable options to consumers. Both markets aim to meet the demand for cyproheptadine, but differ in terms of pricing and manufacturer.</p></p>
