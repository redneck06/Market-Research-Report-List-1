<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Laboratory Centrifuges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bench-top</li><li>Floor-standing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Veterinary laboratory centrifuges come in two main types: bench-top and floor-standing. Bench-top centrifuges are smaller in size and designed to sit on a laboratory bench or table, making them ideal for smaller spaces or laboratories with limited space. Floor-standing centrifuges, on the other hand, are larger in size and designed to stand on the floor, offering higher capacity and more power for processing larger volumes of samples. Both types of centrifuges are essential for separating substances in veterinary laboratories for diagnostic and research purposes.</p></p>
